# DRYa

## DRYa acronym
Don't Repeat Yourself (app) 

## Description
This project is a natural tendency for any entusiastic programmer...

When using any smart device or any computer, there are too many tings that may become repetitive.
Some examples are:
   - After formating your machine, installing all the apps again may be repetitive
   - If you want to perform same tasks everyday, pressing more that one 'start' button and one 'stop' button may be repetititive
   - If you are frequently installing and uninstalling software, configuring the keyboard, preferences, dot files may be repetitive
   - If you use your terminal as your IDE (your editor of choice for programming), not having shortcuts for long commands may be repetitive
   - If you are learning/studying any topic, either for school or for yourseflf, not having a personal wikipedia may be repetitive
   - If you own a smartphone and you don't have a trusted personal assistant, your life may be repetitive
   - For the author, downloading this repository is a shortcut to download every other repository, because it's database aids in the process
   - This repository travels in the author's pocket. Bash runs EVERYWHERE. It is the defaulf shell for Linux, it can run on Windows under WSL and if you install a terminal on you Android or your iPhone like Termux, then you have a software that runs everywhere

This script is a personal software 'configurator', whenever the author finds dificulty in life and a solution is found, it gets centralized in this repository in some way
This repository fits perfectly to it's owner at least. 
 
## Termux (terminal for Android and iPhone)
This repository is written in Bash and Pyhton
Both programming languages can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android (Using Termux) and iPhone (Using Termux)
That means that this software is cross-platform just like any personal assistant should be

For the enthusiastic programmer: Iron man (from the Marvel comics) was a programmer. Where the Iron Suit was like Termux (a dedicated command line, programmed to recognize voice and user input to extend the user habilities)


## Brainstorming
This is a list of all ideas to be put into the project before starting coding
- "If you don't have good friends, program one".
- drya should be the first program installed as soon as you touch any new machine and then can deploy your personal butler, just like a Bash butler called Jarve or a python butler called Mia
- When you open drya app, it should work like a browser where your installed apps may be bookmarked to appear at the main page (gitMenu, jarve, combyene, mia, etc...)
- drya is supposed to be a "software bender". It means that the user may be able to do every single thing in real life with the help of drya nust by givinh simple commands. "If you don't have good friends, program one".
- This script is an incentive to always tweak your machine by the command line OR to automate all GUI tasks, so that you don't have to repeat them
- This is the result of a Linux newbie studying and creating a cross platform app from scratch. I don't think there is no better exercise to practice Linux other than developing my own cross platform util. Drya is a git repository that after downloading, gives you the choice to depoy into your system, a software buttler. The bash buttler (the main one so far) is called Jarve.

Install one of these utilities to backup your config files and this way, after a fresh format, all your settings will be there. You may use this software to improve your tasks, making your computer (machine) work for you instead of you working for the machine. You should simply automate your tasks once and save them at your choosen Butler.
"Don't + Repeat + Yourself + Application": Your personal assistant. Similar to Alexa, Cortana, Siri, jarvis... but as a config and a content manager. Keep your tools, stuff and workflow always up to date in all your devices. Later domotics will be added to the project with proper documentation until it becomes Fool/Noob proof.

## Instalation
1 - If you are using any distro of linux (or even termux with bash) create a directory dedicated for repositories (for example: ~/Repositories)

2 - Change directory to get inside the choosen directory and clone DRYa into it (if you already did clone DRYa somewhere else, just move the directory into that place)

3 - run the install.sh script and the script will plave 3 lines of code inside your ~/.bashrc file that loads DRYa on terminal startup

4 - This repository can install every other repositories from the same author. The majority of software options already come inside DRYa like the phone finder by GPS, car finder by GPS, directory looper etc... (this README.md is under development also)

## Learning Bash On-the-Go
### #uDev: Something under develpment listed to be done soon: List... List... List
If you read the source code you will find many many comments of my own code (Learning bash by practice)
And you will also find another kind of comment "# uDev: Under Development" which are a message to my future self, some idea to remember
If you wish to co-op then you may find these comments and try to script yourself

## Drya can deploy these buttlers:
+ jarve (for domotics, home keeping and remote assistance - an automated linux account on raspberry pi)
+ nan-D (a special kind of file to be left on the smartphone. At specific times, DRYa scans the entire phone in search of these inteligent files)
+ Every other seiva's software can be invoked and instantly configured by DRYa
+ ... 


#### DRYa, termux and Formting your pc
Do you need to format your machine? DRYa may help you while your machine is offline, guiding your steps through the installation. You should also save your configs during the installation into DRYa so that the nest time you remember. By remembering your previous user nickname (for example), DRYa may restore all your config files into the fresh install without them breaking (if your saved configs have another user name, they will not correspond with the new user name, right?)

## Webpage
There is a webpage online from the author. But nothing of DRYa is mentioned there... Therefore, whenever it gets ready. An anoucement is made

## Author
The author is David Rodrigues, also know everywhere as Flowreshe Seiva Naghori D'arve.
