# DRYa
Do not - Repeat - Yourself - Application = Similar to Alexa, Cortana, Siri, jarvis... but to keep your personal config files and tools.

# Description
This is the result of a Linux newbie studying and creating a cross platform app from scratch. I don't think there is no better exercise to practice Linux other than developing my own cross platform util. Drya is a git repository that after downloading, gives you the choice to depoy into your system, a software buttler. The bash buttler (the main one so far) is called Jarve.

## Drya can deploy these buttlers:
+ jarve (for bash)
+ Mel (for python)
+ Bion (for windows batch)
+ ... 

### Do not repeat yourself!
Install one of these utilities to backup your config files and this way, after a fresh format, all your settings will be there. You may use this software to improve your tasks, making your computer (machine) work for you instead of you working for the machine. You should simply automate your tasks once and save them at your choosen Butler.

### Software under development
Jarve is the main focus so far because you can find Bash everywhere, even in a Termux terminal (Androi app)

### Jarve in termux
Do you need to format your machine? jarve may help you while your machine is offline, guiding your steps through the installation. You should also save your configs during the installation into jarve so that the nest time you remember. By remembering your previous user nickname (for example), jarve may restore all your config files into the fresh install without them breaking (if your saved configs have another user name, they will not correspond with the new user name, right?)
