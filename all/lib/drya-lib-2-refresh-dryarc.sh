#  ~/DRYa-IO                 # This lib will attemp to output every verbose to omni-log, but if internet or github is not available, drya-IO will work as a mailbox. Whenever Internet is available, it will be uploaded and the dir is deleted
#  file: un-exported-variables-list.txt   # File of outputs that may be used by other terminal commands as variables (without wlexporting them to the env). Examples: ezGIT.sh sais that if it cannot webscrape github.com correctly, it gives the link "https://github.com/SeivaDArve" so that the browser can go there. But, if the user does not want to use the clipboard to copy the link and past in the browser, then this file comes in handy... the browser can fzf the file and pick one line to navigate to... ANOTHER EXAMPLE: a Qr code is generated via curl and exported to this file. Another apps can pick up
#  test existence of files, directories
