# Description: This file descrives how Seiva D'Arve configures his PC before using it. It describes what operative systems and Partitions he uses

I multiboot several OS's at the same time because I promote harnessing the most of your machine. Every Distro sucks in its own way, remember that... and each distro I choose is to fulfill some need, some gap. (Also, I'm scripting to make them OS's all sync)

- Windows (I need my PhotoshopðŸ”¥)
- Garuda
- Pop OS
- Ubuntu Studio
- Kali
- Arch
- Fedora
+ 1 NTFS partition to share files between Linux and Windows

- TAILS on USB stick
- Kali on USB stick
- Termux on android with Vim and Emacs
