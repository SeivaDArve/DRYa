# Title: bully (or bully-pages (man pages, but stronger))
# Description: An app made for the software developer, that filters the developer's script text and retrieves all arguments from within the text with explanation (the explanation must be a commented line next to the --flag found). (This requires the script to be written in a certain style to facilitate things)
# Use: Whenever you develop a script with flags like: --flag-example, White at the line right below it, what that flag means. This way, this script allows you to avoid unecessary time writting and installing a specific man page for each script

# Setup at terminal startup:
   echo "Drya: Loaded: Bully-Pages (man pages but stronger)"
   alias bully="echo hi"

# Ask for a script to be filtered:
   # ... read v_file


# Filter the script and 1 more line after the pattern found
   # cat $v_file |  grep -A 1 "--flags..." ## uDev: Add one more line to this search
