# Title: list of wifi credentials 
# Description: With the presence of this directory and README file, we remind the user that DRYa can also store wifi credentials

# Use: In order to allow DRYa to be sharable with the linux comunity, no sensitive personal data may exist inside DRYa repository... Therefore, the creator of this script created another private repo with private credentials just like wifi passwords. DRYa will find those credentials and apply them. Currently the repo that is storing such credentials for the creator of this app is called:
 > omni-log

# uDev: DRYa will, in the future, install wifi networks + credentials if available
