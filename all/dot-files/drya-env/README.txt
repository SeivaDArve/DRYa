# Title: DRYa set environment variables
# Description: This directory of environment variables is not realy to be populated. It is just to remind that a set of environment variables will be set by DRYa for the scripting process under: ~/.config/drya/.drya-env
#              DRYa will attempt to be a 'neofetch' for acomodation of the user/creator of DRYa. 

# Use: Whenever source-all-drya-files is sourced, a few functions will run and populate ~/.config/h.h/drya/.drya-env just like a file of newfetch. Such file's variables will be exported to env and then other apps will make use of it

# Variable examples:
   drya-env-os: Linux | Android | Windows | Linux Raspbery Pi >>>>>> ( Lin | Andr | Win | LinRasPi)
   drya-env-terminal: WSL2 | Vanila-Linux | Termux
   drya-env-p-manager: apt | dnf | snap | pkg


# Prompt the user for Default list of users: Miau, Seiva, Risalra
