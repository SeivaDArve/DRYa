Version Log (contents of each version) {
	Version 1 {
		- added: Termux auto configuration and terminal alias working
	}
}

# To upgrade to the next software version you need:
	1. about-bookmarks (when automating the process of importing or experting bookmarks, don't forget to add the usefull bookmarks stored in the smartphones)
	2. This app must update (by "git push") other repos automatically every 1h (for example "omni-log-Dv" which is a repo maintained by the creator and is used to keep the master up-to-date on the "cloud". Or else it can set ezGIT to do it. Or else it can set ezGIT to do it)
	3. Backup emacs (~/.emacs.d)
	4. PATH=PATH:$HOME/bin (if you don't put this at .bash_profile then when you restart the terminal, it will forget (Link tutorial: https://youtu.be/rJMFxIbDe-g)
	5. There should be at ~/tmp/messages.txt ... this way, at every .sh file you can tell it te echo out a file "THIS file was read" without filling the entire screen. DRYa wants to tell each file that it is being run for debugging process (at ~/tmp/messages like emacs does) but does not want to fill the entire screen of the terminal at startup
	6. clear ~/tmp/ at .bash_logout intead of .bashrc
