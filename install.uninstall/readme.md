# Usage
The jarve Installer will copy "./.jarve" into your home folder "~" so that it all gets installed into "~/.jarve". Then all other folders "bin", "etc", "var" etc will be copied into your "~/.jarve/h.h". In the end, you will have only a clean install with only 2 things inside "~/.jarve", it is "~/.jarve/jv.sh" and "~/.jarve/h.h"

# At the beggining, with a FRESH Naked Windows install, instructions must be added to wiki to copy a command into "Win+R: <command>" to make jarve as automated as possible, as simples as possible
