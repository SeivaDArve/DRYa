uDev: este modo pode ser adicionar junto com o instalador principal, para usar tambem no TAILS

Ghost mode is made to Come Into 1 device all of a sudden and then, when needed, removes all of it all of a sudden

The file/script Ghost-In can be stored anywhere and can be left on the machine when not in use

Situation you need Ghost-In

 - You are using the terminal of a friend
 - You are using the terminal on a public place
